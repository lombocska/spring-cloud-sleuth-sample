# Example for Spring Cloud Sleuth 

This is an example app where two Spring Boot (Java) services collaborate on an http request.
It's trying to be a real-life example in a microservice world and proofing how Spring Boot providing auto-configuration for `distributed tracing`.


In a microservices architecture, a single business operation might trigger a chain of downstream microservice calls 
and such interactions between the services can be challenging debugging. 

To make things easier, we can use Spring Cloud Sleuth to enhance the application logs with tracing details.


## MODULES

#### server-one
Serving  GET request on `/` path. This request ends up with calling server-two via Feign on GET `/cat`
and returning its response.

#### server-two
Serving requests on `/cat` path.

## TECH STACK
- Java 11
- Spring Boot Framework
- Spring Cloud Sleuth
- Spring Cloud Feign
- docker-compose
- spotify maven dockerfile plugin
- ELK ( elasticsearch + logstash + kibana)

Both services use the dockerfile-maven plugin from Spotify to make the Docker build process integrate with the Maven build process. 
So when we build a Spring Boot artifact, weâ€™ll also build a Docker image for it. 
For more details, check the Dockerfile and the pom.xml of each service.

## DEFINITIONS
`span id` The span represents a basic unit of work, for example sending an HTTP request.

`trace id` The trace contains a set of spans, forming a tree-like structure. The trace id will remain the same as one microservice calls the next.


```
Spring Cloud Sleuth is a distributed tracing solution and it adds a `trace id` and a `span id` to the logs.
```

## LOGGING
As the microservices will run in Docker containers, we can leave the responsibility of writing the log files to Docker. 

logback-spring.xml configures the logging params based on spring active profile.

## USAGE

1. `./mvnw clean install`
2. `docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose up --build`
3. open `localhost:5601` in your browser
4. Go to discover, create an index with pattern `logstash-*` then choose `@timestamp`
5. request `localhost:8080`
6. in Kibana, Discover you should be able to filter based on `trace.trace_id` and see that the 2 different spring app logged out info with the same trace id

After having attended on the bridge conference and heard about Spring Cloud Sleuth I imminently wanted to try it out.
